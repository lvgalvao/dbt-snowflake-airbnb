# dbt-snowflake-airbnb project

Overview
This project is a data engineering pipeline that uses three tools to extract, transform, and load data. The pipeline uses dbt as the data transformation tool, Great Expectations as the data quality tool, and Preset as the data visualization tool. The pipeline extracts data from different data sources, transforms the data using dbt, applies data quality checks using Great Expectations, and then visualizes the data using Preset.
